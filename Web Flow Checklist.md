## Registration

- [ ] Duplicate registration \\(try with uppercase, +1@..., dots in name, etc\\)
    
- [ ] Overwrite existing user \\(existing user takeover\\)

- [ ] Weak password policy \\(user=password, password=123456,111111,abcabc,qwerty12\\)
    
- [ ] \[Insufficient email verification process\](../enumeration/web/email-attacks.md) \\(also my%00email@mail.com for account tko\\)
    
- [ ] Weak registration implementation or allows disposable email addresses
    
- [ ] Fuzz after user creation to check if any folder have been overwritten or created with your profile name
    
- [ ] Add only spaces in password
    
- [ ] Long password \\(>200\\) leads to DoS
    
- [ ] Corrupt authentication and session defects: Sign up, don't verify, request change password, change, check if account is active.
    
- [ ] Try to re-register repeating same request with same password and different password too
    
- [ ] If JSON request, add comma {“email”:“victim@mail.com”,”hacker@mail.com”,“token”:”xxxxxxxxxx”}
    
- [ ] Lack of confirmation -> try to register with company email.
    
- [ ] Check OAuth with social media registration
    
- [ ] Check state parameter on social media registration
    
- [ ] Try to capture integration url leading integration takeover
    
- [ ] Check redirections in register page after login
    
- [ ] Rate limit on account creation
    
- [ ] XSS on name or email
    

## Authentication

- [ ] Username enumeration
    
- [ ] Resilience to password guessing
    
- [ ] Account recovery function
    
- [ ] "Remember me" function
    
- [ ] Impersonation function
    
- [ ] Unsafe distribution of credentials
    
- [ ] Fail-open conditions
    
- [ ] Multi-stage mechanisms
    
- [ ] \[SQL Injections\](../enumeration/web/sqli.md)
    
- [ ] Auto-complete testing
    
- [ ] Lack of password confirmation on change email, password or 2FA \\(try change response\\)
    
- [ ] Weak login function over HTTP and HTTPS if both are available
    
- [ ] User account lockout mechanism on brute force attack
    
- [ ] Check for password wordlist \\(\[cewl\](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) and \[burp-goldenNuggets\](https://github.com/GainSec/GoldenNuggets-1)\\)
    
- [ ] Test 0auth login functionality for \[Open Redirection\](../enumeration/web/ssrf.md)
    
- [ ] Test response tampering in \[SAML \](../enumeration/webservices/onelogin-saml-login.md)authentication
    
- [ ] In OTP check guessable codes and race conditions
    
- [ ] OTP, check response manipulation for bypass
    
- [ ] OTP, try bruteforce
    
- [ ] If \[JWT\](../enumeration/webservices/jwt.md), check common flaws
    
- [ ] Browser cache weakness \\(eg Pragma, Expires, Max-age\\)
    
- [ ] After register, logout, clean cache, go to home page and paste your profile url in browser, check for "login?next=accounts/profile" for open redirect or XSS with "/login?next=javascript:alert\\(1\\);//"
    
- [ ] Try login with common \[credentials\](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet)
    

## Application Logic

- [ ] Identify the logic attack surface
    
- [ ] Test transmission of data via the client
    
- [ ] Test for reliance on client-side input validation
    
- [ ] Thick-client components \\(Java, ActiveX, Flash\\)
    
- [ ] Multi-stage processes for logic flaws
    
- [ ] Handling of incomplete input
    
- [ ] Trust boundaries
    
- [ ] Transaction logic

- [ ] Check for test credit card number allowed like 4111 1111 1111 1111 \\(\[sample1\]([https://www.paypalobjects.com/en\_GB/vhelp/paypalmanager\_help/credit\_card\_numbers.htm](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm)) \[sample2\](http://support.worldpay.com/support/kb/bg/testandgolive/tgl5103.html)\\)
    
- [ ] Check PRINT or PDF creation for IDOR
    
- [ ] Check unsubscribe button with user enumeration
    
- [ ] Parameter pollution on social media sharing links
